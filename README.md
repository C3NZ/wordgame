# wordgame
Given a list of characters, also known as a hand, create as many or as long of a word you possibly can to get the highest possible score.

## How to play
given a list of characters, in this game also known as a hand, create as many or as long of a word you possibly can to get the highest
possible score. The amount of characters you're given in a hand is hardcoded as `HAND_SIZE = 7`, but changing it will not break 
implementation. You're allowed to pick how many hands you'd like to play however.

## Dependencies
There are none for this project


## Notes
Keep words.txt inside the same folder as wordgame.py in order for wordgame.py to work

This was apart of a problem set from MIT's course which can be found [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/). 
I've licensed my modifications of their software under the GPLv3 which is compatible with their creative commons license. MIT provided helper functions and some of the documentation, 
while I wrote the actual wordgame implementation and documentation for how specific pieces of my implementation works.
